## Project Overview
CareerConnect v2 is a role-based community network where students can showcase achievements, connect with alumni, discover opportunities, and stay accountable through gamified progress. Alumni contribute mentorship, share jobs, and engage with the student community. Admins curate the ecosystem, moderate content, and view platform analytics.

## Product Goals
- Launch a reliable MERN platform connecting students and alumni with actionable opportunities.
- Achieve >60% profile completion for new users within 30 days through guided onboarding.
- Facilitate an average of 3+ meaningful connections per active user per month.
- Maintain <48 hour turnaround on admin job approvals and <200 ms median API latency.
- Earn post-onboarding NPS >6.5 via streamlined flows and responsive UI.

## Personas
- **Student**: Builds profile, applies for opportunities, connects with alumni mentors, tracks achievements.
- **Alumni**: Shares experience, posts opportunities, mentors students, maintains professional visibility.
- **Admin**: Oversees platform health, moderates content, manages users, monitors analytics.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<org>/careerconnect-v2.git
   cd careerconnect-v2
   npm install --prefix client
   npm install --prefix server
   ```
2. Duplicate `.env.example` files in `client/` and `server/` and populate secrets.
3. Seed the admin user once from the server root.
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run seed
   ```
4. Run both apps locally.
   ```bash
   npm run dev --prefix client
   npm run dev --prefix server
   ```
5. Access the client at http://localhost:5173 and login with the seeded admin credentials.

## Deployment Guide
### Frontend (Netlify)
1. Connect the `client/` folder to Netlify (GitHub integration).
2. Build command: `npm run build`. Publish directory: `dist`.
3. Configure environment variables (e.g., `VITE_API_URL`).
4. Add `_redirects` file with `/* /index.html 200` for client-side routing.
5. Enable branch deploys and PR previews.

### Backend (Render / Railway / Vercel)
1. Connect the `server/` repo or subdirectory.
2. Install command: `npm install` (or `npm ci`).
3. Build command: `npm run build` (Render) or use `npm start` with ts-node for Railway.
4. Start command: `node dist/server.js`.
5. Configure environment variables (Mongo URI, secrets, Cloudinary, frontend URL).
6. Set up health check endpoint `/api/ping` and confirm CORS allows Netlify domain.
7. Enable auto-deploy on main branch.

### Database (MongoDB Atlas)
1. Sign up for a free account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas).
2. Create a new project and cluster (choose the free tier M0).
3. Set up a database user with read/write access.
4. Whitelist IPs: For development, add `0.0.0.0/0` (allow all); for production, restrict to your server IPs.
5. Get the connection string from the "Connect" button (e.g., `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.mongodb.net/careerconnect`).
6. Set `MONGO_URI` in `server/.env` to this string.
7. Optionally, set TTL indexes for notifications or other collections.
8. Monitor performance metrics and scale as needed.

## Security Checklist
- [ ] Enforce HTTPS for client and API.
- [ ] Store secrets in Netlify/Render environment settings (never commit `.env`).
- [ ] Hash passwords with bcrypt (salt rounds >= 10).
- [ ] Sanitize and validate all inputs (express-validator).
- [ ] Implement CORS whitelist for Netlify domains.
- [ ] Rate limit auth endpoints and track failed attempts.
- [ ] Add audit logging for admin operations.
- [ ] Regularly rotate JWT secrets and admin seed password.
