# Documentation Overview

All project documentation that is not required for day-to-day development lives inside this directory to keep the repository root clean.

- `archive/` contains historical deployment notes, progress reports, and verification checklists kept for reference.
- Add any new long-form documents here rather than at the repository root.

If a document becomes part of the active workflow (for example, onboarding instructions or architectural decisions), consider promoting a concise version to the main `README.md` and moving the detailed notes into `docs/archive/`.
