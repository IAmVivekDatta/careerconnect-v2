5. [ ] Once deployed, test the API:
   ```bash
   curl https://careerconnect-v2.onrender.com/api/ping
   # Should return: {"status":"ok"}
   ```
6. [ ] Check CORS headers are present in response
7. [ ] Monitor the "Metrics" tab for CPU/Memory usage
8. [ ] Check logs for any runtime errors

### Seed Admin User (if needed)

```

## Production Verification

### API Endpoints (via Render)

curl -X POST https://careerconnect-v2.onrender.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test"}'
# Expected: 400 or 401, not 500
